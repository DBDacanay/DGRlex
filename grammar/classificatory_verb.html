            <p class = "welcomeHeader"> Classificatory Verbs</p> 
            <p class = "welcomeText"> In Tłı̨chǫ, certain verb stems can only be used for describing actions or states involving specific types of physical objects. Consider the following example:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>    

            <p class = "welcomeText"> In English, the same verb (‘is’) is used in both of the above sentences, both to describe a solid object, like an apple, sitting in a container and to describe a liquid, like water, sitting in a container. However, in Tłı̨chǫ, a different verb is used to describe the solid object (wheɂǫ) and the liquid (whetł’ı). Likewise, consider the following:</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>    

            <p class = "welcomeText"> Again, different verbs are used to describe a thin and flexible object, like a cloth, and a rigid object, like a pencil. However, notice that it is only the stem which changes in these verbs; the conjunct and disjunct remain the same.</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>    
            
            <p class = "welcomeText"> Sets of verbs such as these, which describe the same action or state of being, but change stems depending on what different types of physical objects are involved, are called classificatory verbs (or ‘classification verbs’). Although there are many classificatory verbs in Tłı̨chǫ, there is only a relatively small number of classificatory verb stems, and these stems remain consistent in meaning regardless of the verb themes in which they are used. These stems are:</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>    
                        
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -ɂǫ</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -ɂǫ is a general-purpose classificatory verb stem, and can be used for actions involving any solid physical object, as long as that object is singular (that is, there is only one of them). In the dictionary, we refer to verbs using this stem as involving a ‘chunky object’.</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>    
            
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -ɂà</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -ɂà is similar to -ɂǫ, and can be used for any solid physical object, as long as there is only one of them. Like -ɂǫ, verbs in the dictionary using this stem are referred to as involving a ‘chunky object’.</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -ɂà can also be used as placeholder when the shape of an object is unknown.</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -ɂà can also be used to when describing the physical placement of geographic features or locations.</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> In addition to physical objects, -ɂà can also be used when ‘handling’ an abstract object, such as a word or idea.</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>    

            <p class = "welcomeText"> -chı</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -chı is similar to -ɂǫ and -ɂà, and can be used for any solid physical object, as long as there is only one of them. Like -ɂǫ and -ɂà, verbs in the dictionary using this stem are referred to as involving a ‘chunky object’.</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -chı can also be used when the shape of an object is unknown; in the following example, since it is not known if the money will be in the form of coins, bills, or a cheque, -chı is used.</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -chı can also be used for some interactions with living beings. For example:</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>    

            <p class = "welcomeText"> -tı̨̀</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -tı̨̀ is used when handling a long, rigid object. Some examples of objects which fit this description include a frying pan, a piece of firewood, a gun, a bone, a wooden plank, a boat, or an (empty) car:</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>    
            
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -tǫ</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -tǫ is similar to -tı̨̀, and is also used to describe handling a long, rigid object. Likewise, examples of such objects include a boat, a pencil, a stick, a bone, a sled, a gun, or an (empty) car:</p>    
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>    

            <p class = "welcomeText"> -htǫ</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -htǫ is used to describe a hollow container or concave space, usually (but not necessarily) filled with a liquid of some kind.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> -ka</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -ka is used when handling a full container of material.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> -chı̀h</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -chı̀h is used when handling a flat, flexible object, such as a cloth, hide, or a piece of paper. It is also used when describing objects made of flat, flexible material, such as articles of clothing, internal organs (such as a stomach), and sacks. In the dictionary, verbs using this stem are described as involving a ‘cloth-like object’.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> -ɂah</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -ɂah is similar to -chı̀h, and is used when handling a flat, flexible, ‘cloth-like’ object.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> -la</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -la is another general purpose classificatory verb stem, used when handling multiple objects of any kind, including when the objects themselves are of various types. Specifically, -la is used when handling multiple inanimate (that is, non-living) objects. In the dictionary, verbs with the stem -la are described as involving ‘many’ objects.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> -le</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -le is another general purpose stem, used for handling multiple objects of any kind.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> However, unlike -la, -le can also be used when handling animate (that is, living) objects, such as people or animals.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> In the dictionary, verbs with the stem -le are described as involving ‘many objects’.</p>


            <p class = "welcomeText"> -wa</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -wa is similar to -le, being used to describe handling multiple objects of any kind, whether animate (living) or inanimate (non-living).</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> -tè</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -tè is used when handling a single, living being. In the dictionary, verbs using this stem are described as involving an ‘animate object’.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> -da</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -da is similar to -tè, and describes handling a living, animate object.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> -xe</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -xe is used to describe handling a heavy or bulky object. Examples of such objects include:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> -tł’ı</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -tł’ı (also sometimes said as tł’ı̀) is used to describe handling liquids, fluids, or grainy substances. For example:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> -tł’ı can also be used to describe the movement of objects which, although solid on their own, may behave like fluids (that is, flowing and fitting the form of containers) when gathered in great numbers. For example:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> As the above examples demonstrate, classificatory verb stems are not always mutually exclusive; multiple different stems could potentially be used to describe a single object. For instance, to say “Give me a bucket of water”, one could say:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> Given that a bucket of water is both a chunky object and a heavy object, either -chı or -xe could be used in describing handling it. Similarly, łozhaa (‘ashes’) is both plural (being a collection of many, tiny objects) and acts like a fluid. Therefore, to say ‘There are ashes in the cup’, one could say:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>
