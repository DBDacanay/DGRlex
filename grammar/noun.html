            <p class = "welcomeHeader"> Nouns</p> 
            <p class = "welcomeText"> Nouns are words used to refer to physical objects (such as people, animals, places, and objects) and abstract concepts.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>    
                
            <p class = "welcomeText"> Nouns in Tłı̨chǫ can be divided into various subclasses; in the dictionary, we divide them into simple nouns, compound nouns, and phrasal nouns. As their name suggests, simple nouns consist of a single noun, as defined above.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> Nouns in Tłı̨chǫ can be divided into various subclasses; in the dictionary, we divide them into simple nouns, compound nouns, and phrasal nouns. As their name suggests, simple nouns consist of a single noun, as defined above.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> Compound nouns, by contrast, consist of a string of multiple nouns combined together, which act as if they were a single noun.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> Finally, phrasal nouns are more similar in structure to short, formulaic sentences, consisting of multiple nouns, verbs, postpositions, and so on. However, despite their structural complexity, these phrasal nouns function in the greater context of the sentence in the same way as simple and compound nouns.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> Unlike in English, there is no distinction in Tłı̨chǫ between singular and plural nouns; the same form of the noun is used regardless of how many of that noun are present. For example:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> In the above example, when used on its own, it is ambiguous whether tłı̨ refers to one dog or several dogs; to clarify how many dogs are present, one must either specify a particular number or use a quantifier.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> Verb conjugation is also used to indicate whether a noun is singular or plural. For instance:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> In the above example, even though the form of the noun tłı̨ does not change, the use of the subject marker e- in the first sentence indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, the one who is eating, so, the dog) is singular, whereas the use of the subject marker ge- in the second sentence indicates that the subject of the verb is plural. In this way, verb conjugation can specify whether a noun is singular or plural, even though the noun itself does not change.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> Ownership (or possession) of nouns is indicated in Tłı̨chǫ using prefixes, attaching to the beginning of the noun. These so-called ‘possessive prefixes’ are as follows:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> Possession of a noun can also be indicated using so-called ‘possessive pronouns’; distinct, separate words used to indicate ownership. These are:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> Most simple and compound nouns in Tłı̨chǫ can use either possessive prefixes or possessive pronouns to indicate ownership, with little (if any) difference in meaning between the two. However, some nouns (particularly nouns borrowed from English) can only take possessive pronouns. For example:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> It is not fully understood why certain nouns reject possessive prefixes; this matter requires further research and documentation. However, it appears that most simple and compound nouns can accept either possessive prefixes or possessive pronouns, depending on context and the preference of the individual speaker. In the dictionary, nouns which can only accept possessive pronouns are labelled as ‘class 2’ nouns, whereas nouns which can accept either are listed as ‘class 1’.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> Some nouns in Tłı̨chǫ can only occur in their possessed forms; these are referred to as ‘inalienable nouns’, and typically refer to family members, body parts, and some close personal possessions. In contrast, normal Tłı̨chǫ nouns, which may occur without possessive prefixes, can be referred to as ‘alienable’ nouns.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> As the above example demonstrates, the Tłı̨chǫ word for head is -kwı̀; however, a fluent speaker will never use the word -kwı̀ on its own. Rather, they must specify whose head is being referred to using a possessive prefix. For example:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> The possessive prefixes used by inalienable nouns are the same as those used by other, alienable Tłı̨chǫ nouns; the only difference is that inalienable nouns must always have one of these prefixes attached at all times. The only exception to this lies in compound nouns; inalienable nouns may be attached, without a possessive prefix, to another noun to form a new, alienable compound noun. For example:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>
            
            <p class = "welcomeText"> In the dictionary, inalienable nouns are always listed in their first-person plural possessed form (i.e. our), with the prefix go-. All other possible possessed forms for the noun are listed underneath the main entry.</p>
