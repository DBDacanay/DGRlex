            <p class = "welcomeHeader"> Pronouns</p> 
            <p class = "welcomeText"> Pronouns are words used either to replace nouns, generally to refer to specific individuals or objects in a discussion where identities of those individual(s) or object(s) are already known, and therefore do not need to be explicitly stated or repeated. For example:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>    
                
            <p class = "welcomeText"> In this sentence, eyı (‘him/her; that one’) is a pronoun, and refers to ‘the man who made us suffer’. Since this man has already been mentioned earlier in the sentence, it is not necessary to repeat his full description a second time. As such, the next time he is mentioned, eyı is used to refer to him.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> The basic pronouns in Tłı̨chǫ are as follows:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> In Tłı̨chǫ, there is no gender distinction in pronouns; ededı̨ (‘he, she’) can be used to refer to men or women.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> For ededı̨ specifically, there is also no number distinction; ededı̨ can be used to refer to a single person (‘he, she’) or a group of people (‘they’). For example:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> However, unlike in English, there is a distinction in number between nı̨ (‘you’, referring to a single person’) and naxı̨ (‘you, y’all’, referring to a group of people):</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> Naxı̨ can also be used for the first person dual (that is, ‘the two of us’); however, this is not ambiguous, as conjugation on the verb indicates whether naxı̨ refers to the second person plural or first person dual.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> In English, verbs almost always need to be accompanied by either a noun or a pronoun in order to indicate who is performing the action. However, in Tłı̨chǫ, this information is already indicated by the verb itself (through the conjunct); as a result, pronouns are much less commonly used in Tłı̨chǫ than they are in English:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> When pronouns are used, it is typically either to increase the emphasis on who is performing a verb, or to identify someone without using a verb at all. For example:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>

            <p class = "welcomeText"> </p>
