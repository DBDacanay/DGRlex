            <p class = "welcomeText"> <b class = "guideNumbers">1 - Headword:</b> The headword of an entry is the Tłı̨chǫ word to which the entry refers. </p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> <b class = "guideNumbers">2 - Audio Player:</b> If an audio recording exists for the entry in question, an icon of a speaker will appear here. Pressing on this icon will play the relevant audio. If no recording exists, this space is left blank.  </p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> <b class = "guideNumbers">3 - Image:</b> An image of the action or object described by the entry.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> <b class = "guideNumbers">4 - Culture Note:</b> Additional encyclopedic or cultural information about the entry.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> <b class = "guideNumbers">5 - Part of Speech:</b> The grammatical category of the headword (i.e. noun, verb, adverb, postposition). See Grammar for an explanation of each part of speech used.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> <b class = "guideNumbers">6 - Topic:</b> The topic(s) to which the headword pertains. The dictionary uses a hierarchically organised list of topics (or, 'semantic domains'), adapted from the semantic domain list used in the Rapid Word Collection Method, originally developed by Ronald Moe of SIL International. Each topic is given a numerical identifier to indicate its position in the list relative to other topics, as well as a descriptive name; see 'Search by Topic' section for a thorough explanation of how to navigate this topic list. </p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> <b class = "guideNumbers">7 - Source:</b> Where the entry in question comes from. In cases in which the entry was collected specifically for this dictionary, the source is listed as the name of the contributor, followed by the year in which they provided the word in parantheses (i.e. "Rosa Mantla (2024)"). If the entry was taken from an existing written work, the source is listed as the name of the source followed by the year of publication in parantheses. For some sources, from which a large number of entries were extracted, an abbreviation of the title may be used instead of the full title; see the Bibliography for a full list of sources and their associated abbreviations.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> <b class = "guideNumbers">8 - Audio Source:</b> The name of the person who provided the audio recording (left as 'N/A' if there is no recording).</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"><b class = "guideNumbers">9 - Alternate Forms:</b> Alternative pronunciations or spellings of the headword</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"><b class = "guideNumbers">10 - Related Entries:</b>See Also: Related entries or synonyms</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"><b class = "guideNumbers">11 - Definition:</b> The meaning of the headword translated into English. When multiple related translations are possible, they are separated with a semicolon (;) (i.e. kw'àchè - 'skillet; frying pan'). When multiple, unrelated translations are possible, they are numbered and placed on separate lines (i.e. xeh - '1) pack; parcel; bundle 2) blister')</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"><b class = "guideNumbers">12-14 - Example Sentences:</b> One or multiple examples of the headword being used in a sentence. The Tłı̨chǫ sentence is written in bold (12), followed an English translation of the sentence (13), followed by the source of the example sentence in grey text (14).</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"><b class = "guideNumbers">15 - Paradigm:</b> A list of possible conjugated forms of the headword. See the 'Grammar' section on the relevant part of speech to learn about how to create these conjugated forms, as well as for general information on how to read these paradigms.</p>
