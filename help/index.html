            <p class = "welcomeHeader"> Help</p>
            <p class = "welcomeHeader"> Searching the Dictionary</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> The searchbar for the dictionary is located in the centre of the main page, near the top of the screen. You can search the dictionary in Tłı̨chǫ or English; by default, the dictionary will return all entries which contain your search query in either the Tłı̨chǫ word or the English definition. For example, entering 'tam' will return entries such as tamı̨̀ ('net') and tambeh ('scissors'), as well as dıwe ('tamarack') and tsı̨̀ts'ehwhı ('contaminate'). You can also specify a search language using the language buttons in the right-hand corner of the searchbar. By selecting English, only words with your search query in the definition will be returned, and by selecting Tłı̨chǫ, only words with your search query in the English word will be returned. Selecting 'Both' will return the searchbar to its default setting.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> When displaying search results, the dictionary will prioritise displaying exact matches over partial matches. For example, if the query 'horn' is entered, entries that contain the exact word 'horn' (i.e. edè ('horn')) will be displayed before entries which contain the character sequence 'horn' as part of a larger word (i.e. edaghoò ('thorn')). Aside from this, entries are displayed in alphabetical order; first, exact matches are listed in alphabetical order, and then partial matches are listed in alphabetical order. All alphabetisation occurs according the first letter in the Tłı̨chǫ word.
            </p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> To search only for exact matches, excluding all partial matches, you can enclose your search query in double quotes (""). For example, while the search query 'ewò' normally returns over 60 entries (i.e. daèhtewò ('mattress'), ewòhjıh ('hide mitten'), etc.), the search query '"ewò"' only returns the entry ewò. </p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> For some common English words, the dictionary has also been programmed to prioritise certain pre-selected entries, especially for English words which appear in the definitions of many different entries. For example, the English word fish occurs in over 130 entries in the dictionary, and, if listed in alphabetical order, the single best translation for the word 'fish' would only occur about halfway down the list. As such, the dictionary has preprogrammed instructions to return the entry 'łıwe' as the top search result whenever 'fish' is entered as a search query. These pre-selected entries are known as 'keywords'. If an English keyword is entered as a search, the dictionary will first return the corresponding Tłı̨chǫ entry, then all exact matches in alphabetical order, then all partial matches in alphabetical order.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> Many entries in the dictionary have multiple acceptable pronunciation variants, and accordingly multiple possible spellings (see Section X). Entering any of the possible pronunciation variants for an entry as a search query will return the main entry. For example, many fluent speakers pronounce the word jı̀ewà ('blueberry') as dzı̀ewà. Although the dictionary lists the form jı̀ewà as the headword for this entry, entering dzı̀ewà as a search query will return the relevant entry the same as if jı̀ewà was entered.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> The dictionary will automatically return entries matching your search query while you type; there is no need to press 'enter' to input your search. To prevent slowdown, the minimum length for a search query is three characters. However, it is possible to search for words shorter than three characters by specifying an exact search with double quotes ("").</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> The dictionary is able to recognise search queries in Tłı̨chǫ even if they are not spelled in exactly the same as in their entries. You can omit diacritic markers (that is, nasals and low tones) and click markers (') and the search query will still be recognised; for example, the search query "kabatsoo" will still return the entry k'àbatsǫ̀ǫ̀ ('ptarmigan droppings'), even though none of the nasal markers, low tone markers, or click markers were included. You can also use the regular, English "i" instead of the Tłı̨chǫ dotless "ı" in search queries; for example, the search query "goli" will still return the result golı ('chunks of ice'), despite not using the dotless ı. Similarly, the regular English "l" can be used instead of the Tłı̨chǫ barred ł; for example, the search query "liwe" will still return łıwe ('fish'), despite using neither the barred ł nor the dotless ı.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> It should be noted that, while the dictionary can still recognise Tłı̨chǫ search queries without all of the relevant diacritics, the ordering of search results is generally better when queries are written 'correctly' (that is, with all diacritics).</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> A small, built-in keyboard with all characters unique to the Tłı̨chǫ alphabet is located just below the 'Search by Topic' button. Pressing any of the buttons on it will add the relevant character to whatever is already typed in the searchbar.</p>


            <p class = "welcomeHeader"> Searching by Topic</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> The 'Search by Topic' feature allows you to search for all entries in the dictionary which relate to a specific topic, rather than searching for specific, individual words. To access this feature, press the 'Search by Topic' button, located just below the searchbar.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> All entries in the dictionary have been classified into one or several topics. These topics are hierarchically organised and numbered, using a system adapted from a semantic domain list developed in 2001 by Ronald Moe for SIL International (https://semdom.org/). The list consists of nine 'top-level' topics, each of which is subdivided into related, more specific topics, each of which is in turn subdivided into more specific topics, and so on. A unique numerical identifier is attached to each topic, indicating its position in the list relative to other topics. Consider, for example, topic 2.1.3.2 - Leg, which contains all words relating in some way to the human leg. This is the second subtopic under topic 2.1.3 - Limb, which contains all words relating to any human limbs. Other subtopics of 2.1.3 - Limb include 2.1.3.1 - Arm, and 2.1.3.3 - Finger, toe. The topic 2.1.3 - Limb is itself a subtopic of 2.1 - Body, which contains all words relating to the human body; other subtopics of 2.1 include 2.1.1 - Head, and 2.1.6 - Bone, joint. Finally, the topic 2.1 - Body is itself a subtopic of the top-level topic 2 - Person, which contains all words relating to people in general; other subtopics of 2 - Person include 2.2 - Body functions, 2.4 - Body condition, and 2.6 - Life.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> You can click on any of the topics in the 'Search by Topic' menu to display all entries relating to that topic; once you have clicked, simply scroll down. You can also click the '+' icon next to each topic to see its subtopics, which can also be clicked to display all relevant entries. Alternatively, you can search for topics by name using the 'Find a topic' searchbar, located just below the 'Search by Topic' button. </p>

            <p class = "welcomeHeader"> Entry Format</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> Entry cards are formatted as follows, with each element being explained below:</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> Headword: The headword of an entry is the Tłı̨chǫ word to which the entry refers. </p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> Audio Player: If an audio recording exists for the entry in question, an icon of a speaker will appear here. Pressing on this icon will play the relevant audio. If no recording exists, this space is left blank.  </p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> Part of Speech: The grammatical category of the headword (i.e. noun, verb, adverb, postposition). See Grammar for an explanation of each part of speech used.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> Topic: The topic(s) to which the headword pertains. The dictionary uses a hierarchically organised list of topics (or, 'semantic domains'), adapted from the semantic domain list used in the Rapid Word Collection Method, originally developed by Ronald Moe of SIL International. Each topic is given a numerical identifier to indicate its position in the list relative to other topics, as well as a descriptive name; see 'Search by Topic' section for a thorough explanation of how to navigate this topic list. </p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> Source: Where the entry in question comes from. In cases in which the entry was collected specifically for this dictionary, the source is listed as the name of the contributor, followed by the year in which they provided the word in parantheses (i.e. "Rosa Mantla (2024)"). If the entry was taken from an existing written work, the source is listed as the name of the source followed by the year of publication in parantheses. For some sources, from which a large number of entries were extracted, an abbreviation of the title may be used instead of the full title; see the Bibliography for a full list of sources and their associated abbreviations.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText"> Audio Source: The name of the person who provided the audio recording (left as 'N/A' if there is no recording).</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText">Alternate Forms: Alternative pronunciations or spellings of the headword</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText">See Also: Related entries or synonyms</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText">Definition: The meaning of the headword translated into English. When multiple related translations are possible, they are separated with a semicolon (;) (i.e. kw'àchè - 'skillet; frying pan'). When multiple, unrelated translations are possible, they are numbered and placed on separate lines (i.e. xeh - '1) pack; parcel; bundle 2) blister')</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText">Example Sentences: One or multiple examples of the headword being used in a sentence. The Tłı̨chǫ sentence is written in bold, followed an English translation of the sentence, followed by the source of the example sentence in grey text.</p>
            <p class = "welcomeText">Paradigm: A list of possible conjugated forms of the headword. See the 'Grammar' section on the relevant part of speech to learn about how to create these conjugated forms, as well as for general information on how to read these paradigms.</p>
